The following script can detect an anomaly within a dataset that contains information about the sleep patterns of different mammals. <br>
To accomplish this, I..<br>
  1. stored each attribute into an array<br>
  2. calculated the mean of each attribute<br>
  3. calculated the standard deviation of each attribute<br>
  4. told the Python shell to display whether or not one of the values I calculated was anomalous based on..<br>
     a. whether or not the the iterator in the array was greater than "the mean + 2 multiplied by the standard deviation," or:<br>
     b. if the iterator in the array was was less than "the mean - 2 times the standard deviation."
