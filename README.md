The following script can detect an anomaly within a dataset that contains information about the sleep patterns of different mammals. I took the dataset, stored each attribute into an array, calculated the mean and standard deviation of each attribute, then told the Python shell to display whether or not one of the values I calculated was anomalous based on whether or not the the iterator in the array was greater than "the mean + 2 multiplied by the standard deviation" or if the iterator in the array was was less than "the mean - 2 times the standard deviation."
